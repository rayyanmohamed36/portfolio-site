            Raisegrade helps international GCSE students revise their subjects with the help of a bilingual AI tutor.
            I founded the project and developed the AI which was implemented in the leading British school in Doha.
            The project was started as a non profit organization and aims to be implemented in more schools worldwide.

        <div class="project-narrative">
          <p>
            Raisegrade is an AI-powered tutoring platform designed to help international GCSE students improve their
            academic performance through personalized study sessions. The platform was developed in collaboration
            with educators at the British International School in Doha to address the challenges faced by
            bilingual students and enhance their learning experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the backend I stitched together Next.js, Supabase, and OpenAI APIs with a set of guardrails. Students
            prompt the AI tutor and an embedding model retrieves relevant curriculum-aligned resources from a database
            of past papers and revision notes. This context is fed into GPT-5, which generates tailored explanations
            in either English or Arabic, depending on the student's preference. To ensure accuracy, I implemented
            verification steps where the AI cross-references multiple sources before providing answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently the project is being piloted at the British International School in Doha, where initial feedback from students
            and teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. The AI tutor has helped students grasp complex concepts,
            improve their grades, and build confidence in their studies. Moving forward, I plan to expand Raisegrade's
            reach by partnering with more schools within Qatar and globally and continuously refining the AI's capabilities based on user feedback.
