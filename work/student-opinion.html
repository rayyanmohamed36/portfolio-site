        <div class="project-narrative">
          <p>
            TheStudentOpinion started as a project by me with just one other person. We wanted to create a platform where students could share their perspectives on various topics,
            ranging from academics to social issues. As the platform grew in popularity, we attracted more student writers and contributors,
            leading to the formation of an editorial board responsible for curating and publishing content.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the front end I built a site which showcases the latest articles, issues, and author profiles.
            On the backend I developed a custom article management system called Scholarly Intake to streamline the submission and publication process.
            The system allows writers to upload their articles in bulk, which are then automatically processed to extract
            text and metadata, making it easier for editors to review and publish content. This automation significantly reduced the time and effort required to manage submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After launch, an editorial board was created to manage the growing number of submissions.
            The board reported a 40% reduction in time-to-publish, allowing them to focus more on content quality and engagement with the student community.
            TheStudentOpinion has since become a vibrant platform for student voices, fostering a sense of community and encouraging dialogue on important issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing TheStudentOpinion by introducing new features such as multimedia content support,
            interactive discussions, and expanded outreach to include more schools and student organizations. The goal is to create a dynamic
            and inclusive platform that empowers students to share their opinions and experiences with a wider audience.
